## Innovative Idea
Our application would be a database of bathrooms on the UMass campus, and an interface for users rate and provide information about them, similar to Yelp or IMDB. It would allow people to see where the nearest bathroom is and if it meets their requirements (such as having a changing table, being accessible to them, and so on). Ratings would be averaged and displayed.

This application is based off of a project at a hackathon that was never implemented in full. https://dashboard.hackher413.com/projects/16
