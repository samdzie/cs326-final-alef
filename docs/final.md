## UMass Restroom Tracker
### Spring 2020

## Overview 
Our application is a database of bathrooms on the UMass campus, and an interface for users to rate and comment about them, similar to Yelp or IMDB. It allows people to see where the nearest bathroom is and users are able to filter through bathroom requirements (such as having a changing table, being accessible to them, female product disposal, and so on). Ratings would be averaged and displayed.
